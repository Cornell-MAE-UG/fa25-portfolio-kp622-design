In an ENGRD 2020 problem set, we were asked to design a mechanism that would lift the maximum possible weight to a maximum height. In order to achieve this, we were given a 2D design space, 150cm x 50cm, a rigid bar of fixed length, 3 pin supports, two of which would be mounted to the ground, and a linear actuator. The acuator was to be selected by the student from an online catalog of integrated motor rod-style actuators by Tolomatic. I picked the IMA55-RN05 actuator to design my mechanism, and this is my final sketch.
