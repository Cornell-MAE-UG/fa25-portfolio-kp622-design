## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Kayla_Palumbo_Headshot.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Kayla Palumbo, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a Dyson Business Minor for Engineers in progress. Through my education, I am primarily intrested in focusing on the intersection of energy, sustanability, and finance. My experience regarding these topics range from offshore wind infrastructure at Haugland Group LLC to decarbonization projects with the Energy Transition Club here on campus. I hope to continue to contribute to projects that advance technology, reflect smart business strategies, and most importantly benefit people and our environment.
